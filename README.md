CMSC436 Final Project Spring22

### Idea: 
With this app users will take pictures of food labels and the app will extract nutritional information
from the food labels. This capability will be used in some nutritional use case (diabetes or high
blood pressure sufferers, people trying to lose weight, people supporting vegetarian lifestyles, etc.)
Rather than expecting the user to record every single food item they eat the purpose of the app
would instead be to give a visual display to see how a serving size of the food plays into a healthy,
daily diet. For example could show a pie chart with what percentage of daily sodium the serving
would be.
